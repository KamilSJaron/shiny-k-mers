# Allotet
A shiny app for fitting parameters to k-mer spectra of (allo) tetraploids (and diploids).

| Ploidy | Parameters fitted |
|:-------|:-----------------|
| diploid | theta (=heterozygosity) |
| tetraploid (auto) | theta (=heterozygosity between any two genomes of the tetraploid) |
| tetraploid (allo) | theta (=heterozygosity within sub-genomes) and divergence (between sub-genomes) |

The method is going to submitted for publication to Plant Communications.
